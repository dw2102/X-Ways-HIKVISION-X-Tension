# X-Ways-HIKVISION-X-Tension
A X-Ways Forensics X-Tension to parse the HIKVISION filesystem 'HIK.2011.03.08'.

# Usage

After importing the filesystem image (E01, DD etc.) into a case rightclick on the virtual file which represents the unknown filesystem.
Load the X-Tension (HIKVISION.dll or whatever you want to name it) and execute it.

Now all video files should be visible in the volume snapshot.

Video files named '19.01.2038 04:14:07' indicates a file which was not fully finished recording, but is still viewable.

I recommend to read the paper stated below to fully understand the filesystem.

Based on the paper from Jaehyeok Han, Doowon Jeong and Sangjin Lee (Korean University)
